### OSU Winter 2018 Hackathon project: a Better Online Testing Platform

The purpose of the Better Testers Online Testing Platform is to model a better, more user-friendly online test-taking experience.

Studying for and taking exams is already stressful experience for many students, and test anxiety is a real thing that can affect exam results for otherwise competent students. We aimed to alleviate many of the common stress areas that occur with online test taking using the current Canvas testing format as a model for improvement.

Some of the features we focused on include:

- Background color to reduce eye strain and make individual questions more distinguishable.

- Resources such as a scratch pad, a calculator, and question specific images, easily accessible within the question to save time and scrolling for the user.

- Questions completed/remaining tracker that allows the user to easily monitor progress. Users can click directly on each question number in the tracker to be redirected to that question.

- Timer and questions completed/remaining that scrolls with the user to allow the user to always be aware of the time remaining and any questions they may have skipped without having to scroll to the top of the page

- Improving the clickability of questions and answers to ease frustration and alleviate response errors. 


Currently the site is a minimal viable product, and not all components are fully functional. It focuses mostly on the front end user experience for the student. Most of the backend has not been implemented and some of the features have been hard coded in to demonstrate their utility without compromising the functionality of the site itself. 

A demo of this product can be seen [here](https://www.buddhitree.net/).
